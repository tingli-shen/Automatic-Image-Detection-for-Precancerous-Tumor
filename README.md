This model was built on [Pytorch-UNet](https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet). Image data is available here: [data](https://polyp.grand-challenge.org/CVCClinicDB/).

This model implemented image segmentation with U-Net(convolutional networks for biomedical image segmentation) and was trained from scratch with 5000 images with data augmentation because we only had 500 images originally.
